            <font size = "+5"> How How the Atlanta Falcons serve as a role model in creating a Leed Stadium. </font>

        </h1> 

            <p>
                <font size = "+2" >
                    Leed stands for the "Global standard for measuring the Sustainability of a building (...)"

<!-- unordered list-->
            The following items need to be considered when creating a sustainable Stadium:
        <ul>
            <li> Recycle most materials (cups, plates, fan articles, etc.)</li>
            <li> Make Public Transportation easily accessible</li>
            <li> Less Meat for food before games </li>
            <li> Digitalize the ticketing </li>

        </ul>
    

        <!-- ordered list -->
            In addition, there needs to be an emphasis on the materials used to built a stadium:

            <ol>
                <li> Efficient energy usage </li>
                <li> Sustainable energy sources (solar pannels, reusable water, etc. ) </li>
                <li> Planting trees outside the stadium</li>
                
            </ol>


        <!-- Inline span elemts -->
        <p> Not only the stadium of the <span style="border: 1px solid black;">Falcons</span> is a great example. </p>
        Places all around <span style="border: 1px solid black;">Europe</span> are examples of sustainable projects.

                Green Game plan:
            </h3>
            <p> Establishing recycling programs for each of the materials generated is the best way to maintain their quality. Aluminum cans, and plastic & glass bottles are among the recyclable materials that are generated the most by fans. Commingled recycling captures the value of the containers and keeps them separate from fibrous materials. We recommend that all the bins are placed strategically throughout the stadium in high traffic areas, such as near restrooms, hallways, and concession stands so fans can conveniently access them.
